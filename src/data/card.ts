    title: 'AIR',
    tarotReflection: 'Ace of Swords (Air Element: Arrival) What needs to circulate? What wants to elevate? What needs space to renovate?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Labor progresses. Your temperature fluctuates. You become hotter and sweatier, especially during transition and pushing. Cool air fanned on your face and upper body between contractions gives space for a sigh of relief. Air is a wonderful gift. Depending on your birth location and where you are in your labor process, consider your options. Take a walk. Labor outside. Open a window. Ask your support person to use a fan or anything to move the air around you. The coolness of fresh air on your heated body may offer relief and even pleasure as you continue the hard work of birthing.'

    title: 'ANCESTORS',
    tarotReflection: '10 of Pentacles (Virgo) What are the pieces of my process? How do they form a whole? And what is my place among these pieces?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'We are not alone. We carry with us the power and perseverance of generations; of every person who has ever given birth. Just as we were within them, our ancestors remain with us. We draw strength from knowing they crossed these same thresholds. In every moment of labor, we recognize millions of those who have taken on the mantle of birthing the next generation. Your body can do this. You can do this. When labor is hard, accept the connection, communion, and confidence your ancestors offer. To your ancestors. To the community of birthers. To all who have crossed this threshold.'

    title: 'ASK',
    tarotReflection: 'Page of Swords (Air Element: Renewal) Where are new eyes needed and how might they encourage wonder? What does my awe inspire?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'As a companion, you may not know what to say or do in a given moment. In the quiet spaces between contractions, you can always ask, “What do you need to hear right now?” The answer may be: nothing. Or the birthing person may not know how to answer. Regardless, extending this opportunity for the birthing person to ask for the support they need is incredibly validating and empowering.'

    title: 'BIRTH IS MESSY',
    tarotReflection: 'The Tower (Mars/Aries) What’s ready to rip? How can I embrace my own willpower, as one of many wills, in this world?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Birth is not polite, nor proper, nor neat. Birth is messy, and loud, and beautiful! Put aside your social self and surrender to each moment as it is. Leak and bleed and poop and cry and yell! Reject embarrassment and embrace the messiness of birth! Your birth team knows: the bigger the mess, the closer you are to birthing your baby. Your birth team has seen it before. And your birth team will take care of the mess. Allow your instincts to take over. Birth is messy, and loud, and beautiful! Embrace the messiness!'

    title: 'BREATHE',
    tarotReflection: 'Page of Cups (Water Element: Renewal) What does my heart want to call home? How can I let more of my love in and out without controlling the aperture?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'The intensity of labor often causes us to hold our breath and tense our bodies. This restricts oxygen and takes our focus out of the present moment. Instead of giving into the impulse, try to connect. Connect with your breath and ground yourself in the present moment. Connect with your breath to focus your attention and relax your body. Breathe deeply into your abdomen like you’re filling a balloon. Slowly empty the air out on the exhale. Fill. Empty. Fill. Empty. Repeat for at least 3-5 cycles of breath and notice how you feel. Practice deep breathing prenatally to prepare for your birth experience and support you in your pregnancy.'

    title: 'CATCH YOUR BABY',
    tarotReflection: 'The Empress (Venus/Taurus + Libra) What do I have the right to receive? Which of my senses want to become more saturated?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'You have options and opportunities to engage your senses of sight and touch as your baby is being born. To explore the options, imagine the moments just before and at birth. Will you want to touch your baby’s head as they crown? Will you want to watch your baby in a mirror when they crown? How could your senses provide extra encouragement in that moment? Perhaps you or your partner want to have a hand in “catching” the baby as they emerge? Let your support team know what you imagine will be helpful or encouraging. Ask them to help you access tools to fully engage in the birth of your child.'

    title: 'CHANGE IT UP',
    tarotReflection: 'The Wheel of Fortune (Jupiter/Sagittarius) What wild ways are available? And what acts of creation want to be sent their own way; how might I let my creations have adventures of their own?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Movement is your friend in birth. Your baby is moving through the birth canal and into the world. Changing positions throughout this process will help your body accommodate baby and manage the physical sensations and emotional quagmires of birth. Avoid getting “stuck” in one place. Try a new position or movement. What feels good in the moment? Go for a walk. Climb stairs. Lie down. Turn music on. Turn music off. Labor alone. Head outside or down the hallway. Use a different comfort measure. Labor is a process. Listen to your body. Change it up to make birth easier for you and baby.'

    title: 'COUNT WITH ME',
    tarotReflection: '4 of Pentacles (Capricorn) How might creating structure spark self-reliance? What boxes must be built?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'As you move through labor, counting can provide a helpful counter-focus for your attention. Try counting your breaths to help anchor your mind. Count through contractions to track the length and anticipate time for rest. Hold onto the rhythm. Ground yourself with this concrete focal point for your mind. Count aloud to center yourself, ground yourself, and remain in the moment.'

    title: 'DEEP CLEANSING BREATH',
    tarotReflection: '4 of Cups (Cancer) Which feelings are mine to nourish and explore? And which feelings are meant to be released?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'This is a wonderful segue after a contraction has passed. A deep, cleansing breath cues your body to let everything from the last contraction go. Use the break to relax and restore as fully as you can.'
  },

    id: 10,
    imageSrc: '/images/WOB cards_10.png',
    title: 'DIM THE LIGHTS',
    tarotReflection: 'Death (Scorpio) What invisible processes are alive in the dark? How can I camouflage myself into these acts of creation?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Our bodies require a sense of safety to release birth hormones. In addition to internal cues, our bodies respond to a variety of environmental cues to determine how safe we feel. Bright lights tend to put our nervous system on alert. Darkness is soothing. Low lighting and other nighttime cues can quiet stress hormones, decrease the volume of our thinking brain, and (in the case of “sexy time”) support the natural production of birth hormones like oxytocin. Dim the lights during labor. Combined with the comfort of your support team, low lighting cues relaxation, enhances feelings of safety, and allows birth hormones to flow freely.'

    title: 'DRINK',
    tarotReflection: '6 of Cups (Scorpio) Where do I go to find water? Which parts of my process have become parched and are in need of sustenance and fluidity?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Your body works hard during labor! Staying hydrated is incredibly important to maintain your energy. You can tell your support team when you’re thirsty. Better yet, someone can be standing by with a drink and straw at the ready. Being able to take sips between contractions and as needed — especially without having to ask — is a perfect way to receive support. Water or ice are options. Drinks with electrolytes and sugar will give you the fuel you need to keep going, whether coconut water, Gatorade, or your favorite juice. Warm broth may also be a good option to have available if that appeals.'

    title: 'FIND YOUR RHYTHM',
    tarotReflection: 'Knight of Cups (Mutable Water/Pisces) How might I go “with” more of what’s unfolding? What slips me into the stream of creative flow?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'If labor is the ocean and contractions are the waves, then rhythm is the vessel we ride to carry us to shore. Many different patterns serve as rhythms to support our sense of safety. Movement. Breath. Sound. Focus. Touch. Any time you feel overwhelmed, return to your rhythm. Seek out consistency, reliability. Get back on board your ship, where you can feel the waves without being drowned.'

    id: 13,

    title: 'FIRE',
    tarotReflection: 'Ace of Wands (Fire Element: Arrival) Where is the pulse—which parts of my process are switched “on”? And where is the heartbeat—which passions want to be pledged?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Birth is an elemental experience. Air. Water. Earth. Fire. Most birthing people feel the “Ring of Fire” during unmedicated births. As baby crowns, the perineal tissue stretches to allow the baby to pass through, which causes a burning sensation. Though the sensation is short-lived, the Ring of Fire often carries spiritual significance. It is the threshold between pregnancy and birth. Between the person you were and the person you are becoming. Breathe your way through the Ring of Fire. You are so close. This is it. Your baby is right there.'
  },

    id: 14,

    title: 'GO INWARD',
    tarotReflection: 'The Hermit (Virgo) Who am I to myself right now—a lover, a teacher, a friend, an opponent? How might I meet more of the Self that I am Becoming?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Your true power resides deep inside of you. So go inward. Go inward to find your strength. To discover faith in yourself or a higher power. To hear the voice inside of you that knows you are perfectly capable of birthing your baby. Go inward when you are uncomfortable, distracted, overwhelmed. Go inward when you feel tired, spent, or despairing. Go inward if the intensity of labor threatens to pull you under. Closing your eyes or laboring alone for a while may help you go inward and connect with your true power. And your birth companions can support you by mentioning this cue when they sense you need to hear it.'

    title: 'GO LOW',
    tarotReflection: 'Queen of Pentacles (Cardinal Earth/Capricorn) Where am I coming from—what is my foundation and how do I firm up? Where is the core of my Self?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'This cue encourages the birthing person to drop their body weight, or drop the tone of their voice. Our instinct can be to resist the intensity of sensations by lifting up and away — either physically or vocally. But the truth is that the only way out is through. “Go low” (or “drop down”) to make your way through the intensity.'
  },
  {
    id: 16,
    imageSrc: '/images/WOB cards_16.png',
    title: 'GO TO THAT PLACE',
    tarotReflection: 'Queen of Swords (Cardinal Air/Libra) What wants to be sanctified? What wants to be safe-guarded? What is my peace of mind and how might I protect it?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Where is your safe space? What visualizations evoke peace? How can you connect with your spirituality, higher power, faith, or energy? If you wish, prepare your visualizations in advance. During labor, your support companions can remind you to call forth these images and feelings of comfort. “Go to that place” is an encouragement to block out unhelpful stimuli. “Go to that place” is an encouragement to seek out safe guidance on the journey. Your support team can use this phrase during any phase of labor. When they sense your need for safety, calm, peace, or strength, this cue can help.'

    title: 'GRIEF',
    tarotReflection: '5 of Cups (Scorpio) How might I honor what’s empty? How might I bring more of my presence to places of absence?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Alongside the joy and excitement of your birth experience, you may feel grief or loss. These feelings are just as natural, expected, and valid as any other. Grief can stem from any number of places. The loss of an idealized birth plan. The loss of the intimacy and safety associated with pregnancy. Of the life lived before the baby. Of other lives lost — children, siblings, parents, loved ones. Birth and death are deeply connected in the human experience. Joy and sorrow are likewise connected. Your emotions are natural. Let it be. Give yourself space for whatever feelings surface as you welcome this new life into the world.'

    title: 'GROUND',
    tarotReflection: 'Ace of Pentacles (Earth Element: Arrival) Animal: What nourishment is needed? Vegetable: What wants to be tended? Mineral: What matter matters most?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'What grounds you? While everyone has a unique response, there are some common grounding forces that support many birthing people during labor. Touch grounds us. Firm, steady counter-pressure, especially during contractions. Presence grounds us. People who offer continuous, calm support. Certain environments ground us. The familiarity of home, or the care we receive from a hospital or birth center. Objects ground us. Items of comfort or sentimental value. What grounds you? Reflect on ways to incorporate these elements into your birth experience.'

    title: 'HAIR',
    tarotReflection: '5 of Wands (Leo) How might I become my own companion during creative catharsis? How can I supplicate to the sticky parts of my process?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Do you have long hair? If so, this tip is an easy way to hit the reset button during labor. Allow your support companions to re-do your ponytail or bun. A gentle scalp massage is another great way to feel cared for and refreshed. You may want help with your hair after a shower or bath. Or in preparation for nausea or vomiting. Or between contractions. However, not everyone enjoys having their hair touched. Communicate your preferences to your companions.'

    title: 'HOLD ME',
    tarotReflection: '4 of Wands (Aries) How might I lean back into the life I’ve created? How might I exalt the enoughness of my efforts?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Physically holding or hugging a birthing person is a potent way to offer support during labor. Holding and hugging allows the birthing person to share the physical weight of labor and receive emotional comfort all at once. Bolster the birthing person’s emotional and physical strength. Encourage them to relax into the safety of your arms, knowing they are completely supported on every level.'
  },

    id: 21,

    title: 'HOLD MY HAND',
    tarotReflection: '6 of Pentacles (Taurus) Where am I spilling over? What have I got to give? And where can my palms open to receive?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Touch helps oxytocin flow and can provide relief through counter-pressure. However, touch does not have to be enveloping (as a hug) or firm to offer comfort. Sometimes all the birthing person needs is a hand to hold. Holding hands — and squeezing when necessary! — is a beautifully simple way to connect.'
  },

    id: 22,
    imageSrc: '/images/WOB cards_22.png',
    title: 'HOT AND COLD',
    tarotReflection: '7 of Wands (Leo) What creations am I clutching in my hot little hands? And how might I loosen my hold without losing heart?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'During the birthing process, comfort is often found through counter-action. Your body temperature fluctuates throughout labor. Usually it rises as the moment of birth gets closer. Counteract the discomfort of heat by applying a cool compress to your forehead, neck, chest, or face. Your support team can have two washcloths at the ready. While one is in use, soak the other in ice water. At the other end of the spectrum, you may welcome heat as a comfort measure. A warm compress on your belly or lower back helps muscles relax. A warm shower or bath may feel wonderful if you don’t mind getting wet. Heat and cold can both serve as focal points, taking some of your attention away from the sensation of contractions.'

    title: 'ICE',
    tarotReflection: '5 of Swords (Aquarius) What provokes my sharpest reactions? How might I cool my chemistry through compassion?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Ice chips are one great perk of a hospital birth! The combination of crunch and cold is extremely refreshing. Keep a cup of ice chips handy to munch on between contractions and during transition and pushing. Once your support team knows you like ice chips, they can offer the cup to you without prompting. It’s nice to have what you need before asking when possible.'

    title: 'I KNOW',
    tarotReflection: 'The High Priestess (The Moon/Cancer) How do I listen? What does silence sound like to me? What speaks from this silence?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'When someone demonstrates empathy, our feelings and experiences are validated and normalized. We are then able to more easily accept what is happening and how we are feeling. “I know. I hear you. I’m here with you.” “I know, this is hard.” “It’s intense, so much pressure.” “I know, it’s hard when your birth plan needs to change.” “I know, this is such hard work. You’re doing great.” Mirroring the birthing person’s language is even more validating. If they use the word “intense,” for example, repeating it back to them is especially reassuring. You are heard. You are seen. You are not alone.'

    title: 'INNATE',
    tarotReflection: 'The Hierophant (Taurus) What kind of knowing permeates my cells? What can I form from the inside out?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Whether you experience concern toward the beginning of labor or toward the end when you are super close to meeting baby, this affirmation can mean the world. “You were made (born) to do this.” “You have everything you need in you to birth your baby.” This can be the exact thing you need to hear to summon the strength to push through. You grew and carried this baby through your pregnancy despite moments of great effort and discomfort. You can do this too. You already have the strength and innate ability within you. Your body has the capacity to do exactly what needs to be done during labor. And it’s nice to be reminded of that. (A crisis of confidence or period of self-doubt is considered a sign of progress in labor.)'

    title: 'IT IS YOUR CHOICE',
    tarotReflection: 'The Magician (Mercury/Gemini + Virgo) How can I open to the arrival of creative form? How do I want to wield what’s arriving? What wants to come through me and how will I translate it?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Birth is full of valid choices. One person’s choice is not any better or worse than another’s just because it is different. Birthing at home or in a hospital. Unmedicated or with an epidural. Laboring while standing or sitting. Pushing on your hands and knees or while lying down. Having a doula or not. Free yourself from judgments — others’ judgments about your decisions and your own about others’. What may feel right for one family may not work for another. These are choices you get to make for yourself. This is your birth. You have power. And you get to own each choice you make. Do you need more information in order to feel confident in a decision? Ask! A true emergency is extremely rare. There is time for you to choose freely.'

    title: 'IT’S ALRIGHT TO CRY',
    tarotReflection: '8 of Cups (Pisces) What am I leaving? What is already leaving me? How can I keep loving it through the letting go?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Important events fill us with emotion! Birth is important, life-altering truly! Tears are normal and healthy. In fact, a good emotional release is sometimes just what we need for labor to move along. Let it out. Let the tears flow. Tears during labor and birth are as natural — and often as necessary — as pee or sweat or blood.'

    title: 'JUST THIS ONE',
    tarotReflection: 'Page of Wands (Fire Element: Renewal) What new face is facing me? What aspects of me are alive right now that have never been here before?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Birth is an exercise in mindfulness. Like life itself, birth cannot be experienced all at once. We journey through the process one breath at a time. One contraction at a time. One moment at a time. When you begin to feel overwhelmed or get ahead of yourself, your birth team can remind you: just this one. “You can make it through just this one breath — contraction — moment.” We cannot experience anything beyond right now. Just this one. No judgments, comparisons, expectations. We arrive at the goal by focusing on just this one, right here, right now.'

    tarotReflection: '3 of Swords (Libra) What can my head help my heart turn loose? What hard truths can now head on their way?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'If you find yourself holding onto tension in your body or ruminating over the last contraction, you may need a cue to come back to the present. “Let the last one go.” Optimize breaks by resting deeply. You’ll find renewed energy for the next wave when you let the last one go.'

    title: 'MANTRA',
    tarotReflection: 'The Chariot (Cancer) How might I caretake my own coming-of-age? What comforts might I call upon to carry me through?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'What words are affirming for you? What do you want to remind yourself of during your birth? Take some time in advance to reflect on these questions. What meaningful phrase can you use as a mantra during labor? Some common mantras or birth affirmations include: I can do this. I have what it takes to birth my baby. I can release. I can let go. I am strong. I am safe. My baby is coming. You may choose to create visual reminders or birth art around these meaningful words of encouragement. And repeating your mantra — silently or aloud — can offer a positive, steady focal point as you ride the waves of sensation throughout your labor.'

    title: 'MOTHERING',
    tarotReflection: 'King of Cups (Fixed Water/Scorpio) How might I become a home for more humanness? What am I here to help humanize?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Mothering as a verb transcends binary gender identities and biological relationships. Women who are not mothers (n) can mother (v). He, she, they can all mother in unique ways. To mother is to nurture, protect, tend, care, and birth. As the birth unfolds, each person has a profound opportunity to connect with their own power to mother. Draw from this energy to breathe new life into your birthing process. Stoke the fire of excitement as the act of mothering draws you closer to meeting your baby. During the winding road of birth, you are mothering.'

    title: 'MOVE YOUR WAY',
    tarotReflection: 'The Fool (Uranus/Aquarius) How can I inhabit the unfamiliar? What wants to be emptied of expectation and given room to move?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Listen to your instincts during the birth process, especially if you feel the urge to move or change positions. It’s like jiggling a key in a lock. Turning a little bit this way or that helps babies make their journey through the birth canal. If left undisturbed, your intuition will guide you into different positions as your baby descends. With an epidural you may not be able to feel things in the same way. Yet you can still change positions in bed to support your baby through the journey. (Penny Simkin’s “The Roll Over” is a wonderful resource to encourage movement with an epidural.)'

    tarotReflection: 'King of Wands (Fixed Fire/Leo) What is generating within me? How might I generously offer more of this natural glow?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Music can be a strong birthing companion in and of itself. Music shifts our energy, which makes it a powerful tool in the birthing space. Consider preparing two different playlists. One to calm, soothe, and support deeper relaxation and rest. The other to energize and encourage movement, confidence, and positivity.'

    tarotReflection: 'The Star (Aquarius) What kind of oracle am I? How and what do I see on the Horizon?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Connecting with the ultimate purpose of your labor is motivating. A mantra like, “My baby is coming!” can tether you to your baby and provide a rush of emotional or physical energy when you need it most. It doesn’t matter whether the birth will happen in 5 hours, 10 hours, or 10 minutes. Baby is coming. The process may be hard work, but the end result is exhilarating!'

    title: 'NIGHT',
    tarotReflection: 'The Moon (Pisces) What wants to “take” me? What haunts me? How might I melt into more of my own multitudes and mystery?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Because of the way birth hormones work, labor is likely to begin at night. Regardless, you can expect to lose at least one night’s sleep for the birth of your baby. It’s also not uncommon for labor to extend into a second night, especially for first babies. You will likely be tired at some point during your birth experience. But no matter how tired you feel, even if you think you are too tired to do it, no one is ever too tired to birth their baby. You have the reserves. You will find the energy. Prepare for the loss of sleep. Prepare to feel tired. Prepare to rest in early labor or whenever you can. Prepare to get a boost from sweet beverages or snacks. Over the course of one night or many, your companions can support you by staying awake with you.'

    tarotReflection: 'The Sun (The Sun/Leo) What wants to be called by its name? How might honoring “this” allow things to become even more of what they already are?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Your body, your pelvis, your cervix, must soften, relax, and open to make way for the baby to emerge. “Open” or “opening” is a good cue for your body to release tension. Visualizations are effective complements to the verbal cue, helping you align your body, mind, and spirit as you progress through the birth process.'

    tarotReflection: '2 of Cups (Cancer) What has been driven apart? What longs to come in from the cold and reunite?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'You are never alone. Even without a birthing companion, you always have a birth partner in your baby. Talk to your baby. Feel baby’s movement and kicks. Listen to the heartbeat monitor. Dance with them and rock them as they descend through the birth canal. You and your baby can support and encourage each other throughout labor and birth. Neither of you are ever alone. You and your baby are in it together.'

    tarotReflection: 'Temperance (Sagittarius) What is my higher “Why?” What wants to be sent up and away? How can I embody a greater surrender by turning it loose?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'A peaceful environment is one that promotes feelings of safety. And when birthing people feel safe, birthing hormones flow more freely. Engage your senses to create a peaceful birthing space. Nature sounds, enjoyable music, or quiet. Dim lighting or candlelight. People who put you at ease. Textures that provide comfort. Relaxing scents. Comforting touch. However you choose to nurture or affirm it, knowing you are welcoming your baby into peace will support you in creating a beautiful, empowered birth experience.'

    tarotReflection: '10 of Swords (Gemini) Where am I being invited to get up and out of my head? How might I find the answers by losing my mind?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Total permission. Unconditional acceptance. Complete trust. We all long to know that there’s nothing we could say or do to elicit judgment. That is the ultimate support. In the birthing room, no one is judging you. It’s okay to poop, fart, vomit, complain, cry, yell, be scared, be alone, change your mind, leak a variety of bodily fluids... unapologetically. You deserve this freedom and acceptance. After all, these things are very likely to happen as baby comes into the world. And it’s all okay! There is no risk. You are loved and accepted, no matter what! “There’s nothing you could say or do...” Sharing whatever feels most authentic on the part of the support team will hopefully help the birthing person realize how amazing they are, regardless of any passing insecurities.'

    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Labor is often characterized by pain or pressure. But we can also view the experience through the lens of power. The uterus is a powerful muscle. Birth hormones are powerful chemicals. Your internal force is powerful. As labor progresses, the power builds on itself. We can embrace that power and experience deep safety and trust within it. Let that power move you, and move through you. Surrender to the power, be it physical, emotional, or spiritual.'

    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Simply put, your lower back is the other side of your uterus. Discomfort, pressure, and even pain in your lower back are common experiences as your baby descends through your pelvis. Baby’s position can intensify these sensations. And sometimes the sensations are present throughout the birthing process. When back labor presents itself, your birth team can support you by putting pressure on your lower back. Add a warm compress and the relief will be golden!'

    tarotReflection: '2 of Wands (Aries) How might I become the protagonist in my own creation myth? Where am I being coaxed to verb something into being?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'The urge to push is instinctive. Birth professionals even refer to it as the expulsion reflex. Sometimes medicated birth can get in the way of this instinct, but discussing this stage of labor with your care provider in advance will help. The urge may feel like a lot of rectal pressure, even with an epidural, and may mimic the sensation of pooping. This stage of labor may take time as baby negotiates a way through your pelvis. Much like getting a car out of a snow bank, babies will rock forward and backward many times as they pass the pubic bone. Don’t be discouraged. It can be normal to take hours from the first urge to push to the baby’s arrival. Remember: “You’ve got this.” “You’re doing it.” “You’re so powerful.” “You’re amazing.” Verbal encouragement can be especially helpful at this stage. The urge to push can be an empowering feeling. You may even be surprised by how much better it feels to reach this part of labor because you can work with your contractions by bearing down in rhythm with them. You are passing triumphantly through a major portal! Claim your power by waiting for the urge, and advocating for the freedom to push in different positions.'

    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'While music or words of affirmation are often welcome in the birth space, sometimes a birthing person needs quiet instead. Especially at the hospital, keeping the birthing room door closed helps nurture the quiet, relaxing, and safe environment that supports the smooth progression of labor. It is important that all birthing companions be mindful of the need for quiet when it arises. Resist the urge to have mundane side conversations while the birthing person is deep in labor. Peripheral conversations can be highly distracting and disruptive to the birth flow.'

    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Sometimes a birthing person will lose track of, or forget about a labor preference. You can ask your birthing companion to support you by reminding you of your expressed wishes if necessary. For example, “I want to remind you, you wanted to birth on hands and knees. Or, you wanted to catch your baby. Or, you wanted to delay the cord clamping, etc” It’s possible to change your mind in the heat of the moment. That’s okay! Accept any reminder with gratitude. Your companion is simply considering and honoring your wishes.'

The rhythm and sensation of rocking hips side to side or round and round can help with pain management. Being held while rocking with a companion can offer the utmost comfort, as long as the birthing person leads the rhythm.'

    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'People often imagine a baby to be a passive passenger in the birthing process. In fact, babies spiral through the birth canal. They complete several sequential movements to facilitate their rotation around and through the bony structures of the pelvis. You can prepare baby for optimal alignment during pregnancy. Stretch often, and pay attention to your positions while sitting and sleeping. When labor comes, remain active, upright, and free to move. You can work with your baby to achieve the smoothest possible progression of labor. This process is largely instinctive. At the same time, learning about optimal fetal positioning is good for prenatal preparation. (Some good sources of information are: Spinning Babies, Gilligan’s Guide, Miles Circuit, midwives, and doulas.)'

    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'A foot massage may not be something you’d want in active labor, but a well-timed foot rub can be extremely grounding. At the end of pregnancy, a foot rub can reduce swelling and possibly encourage labor. In early labor, at the start of an induction, with an epidural, and even during the postpartum period, foot rubs promote relaxation. Any birthing companion looking to give hands-on support should put foot rubs at the top of their list.'

One way to transform this internal resistance is to simply say “yes.” Proclaim your “yes” out loud. Chant your “yes” internally. Continue to breathe and rock your body as you say yes to the contractions and ride those big waves of sensation.'

    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Shaking is a natural and even helpful part of labor. Hormonal changes that occur as labor progresses makes the birthing body shake in a way that looks like shivering. Shaking is simply your body’s way of releasing tension. It can be reassuring to be reminded that this involuntary and uncontrollable shaking is a normal physiological part of birth. Voluntary shaking movements — of the hips or legs, for example — also release tension. Companions can look up “shaking the apple tree” for guidance on a particular technique to help release residual tension after a contraction passes. Voluntary shaking may deepen the birthing person’s ability to rest and relax between contractions.'

Silence communicates an unconditional affirmation. Silence communicates complete trust that the birthing person is doing everything exactly right. Silence allows companions to intentionally hold space for the birthing person. Don’t hesitate to ask for or offer silence. Quiet is often exactly what the birthing room needs.'

    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Often, our instinct is to hold tension in our shoulders during labor. We pull our shoulders up and away from the deeper sensations of our lower body. Or we strain with our shoulders during the pushing phase. Verbal reminders to soften or drop your shoulder down can be helpful. A shoulder massage is also a good option — with or without an epidural. Massage soothes, promotes relaxation, and releases tension. Shoulder massages are usually most beneficial between contractions, rather than during contractions when counter-pressure is typically the preference. This is a fun technique to practice during pregnancy, too!'

    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Most people will lose at least one night’s sleep in the process of birthing a baby. Lying down and trying to sleep when you can is a smart way to conserve your energy. Accept your companions’ encouragement to rest whenever possible. Opportunities to sleep often occur when early labor begins at night, when the water breaks before contractions begin, while there is still significant space between contractions, or while waiting to be induced. It’s completely natural to feel excited at the beginning of labor! However, birth professionals will often recommend sleeping until labor picks up pace, at which time the birthing person may be unable to comfortably remain lying down. Take a hot shower. Drink a soothing cup of herbal tea. A birthing companion can offer a foot massage or shoulder rub. Sleep while you can. Soon enough you will have plenty of work to do.'

Reminders to soften specific body parts guide us into deeper relaxation and surrender. Soften your shoulders, jaw, and face. Rather than anticipating the next contraction, focus on softening. It can reduce your experience of pain and help pass the time. “Soften Where You Can.” Also “Relax.” “Let go.” “Release.” “Melt.”'

Reflective validations normalize an experience and can be comforting. While it may feel like “SO much pressure,” the validation reminds the birthing person it is not TOO much pressure. The sensation of pressure is simply what birthing a baby feels like.'

    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'When labor feels challenging, it’s not uncommon to hear a person say they want to go home, ask how long they’ll have to do this for, or try to pull their body up and away from what they’re feeling deep inside. “Stay here” calls the birthing person back to this breath, this contraction, this present moment. If we don’t try to skip ahead, we are better able to handle what’s happening right here, right now. Giving birth is the ultimate mindfulness practice. Stay here, and allow your body to do whatever it needs to birth your baby.'

    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'The hip squeeze is a classic counter-pressure move. Companions can use this technique during contractions to diminish the intensity of sensations. The pressure also helps open the pelvis, which in turn supports baby’s descent through the pelvic bones. The hip squeeze technique can be used whether the birthing person is seated, kneeling or standing, as long as their hips are exposed. Place your hands on the fleshy part of the birthing person’s hips and squeeze. When it feels right, that’s the spot!'

People seeking birth as a spiritual experience often appreciate this cue, as it is also a reminder to surrender to a higher power. But not everyone will want to hear this one. While similar to phrases like, “Let go” and “Soften,” being reminded to surrender evokes an awareness that no one is in complete control during the birthing process. Instead, we work together with the baby, with our instincts, and our support team to allow the process to unfold as it will.'

Embrace the birthing person while offering verbal reassurance that they are, indeed, completely supported. Encouragement to surrender often accompanies the cue to drop down.

So instead of gripping your squat bar, or clenching your face, rest. Birth partners can use a cue like “Take your break” to rebound you to rest. Release tension.

If you’re looking for the next thing to do as a support person, try offering to draw a bath or help the birthing person into the shower.

The vibrations soothe our nervous system and support a sense of safety. These deep tones can also help you relax your jaw and encourage full-body relaxation as you ride each wave of sensation. Take comfort in the realization that these vocalizations actually support the unfolding process of birth. And it is okay to be loud! While some people give birth quietly, many do not. Your care providers know that the growing intensity, volume, and depth of birthing sounds often reflect labor’s progress.'

In early labor, the process may seem slow as you wait for your body and baby to take over. Unless there is medical indication to induce or actively manage labor, there’s nothing you need to do except — wait. Later in labor, you may experience a lull in momentum. Or it may feel as though it’s taking forever. Rest. Your body and baby are working together. If your care providers are advocating for interventions during waiting spaces, ask questions about risks, benefits, and alternatives. Since there is evidence that a large number of cesarean births would be avoided if labor was given more time, waiting may be the best course of action. This is not intended as medical advice, only a prompt to speak with your trusted care provider about all your options.'

    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Birth is wild. There are certainly modern elements that tame the experience. But at its core, the birth process awakens our inner animal. During labor, our instincts are at their peak. Our heightened awareness of the sounds and smells around us help us know when we are and are not safe. In the wild, animals will slow or speed up labor depending on the circumstances and how close they are to giving birth. Human animals are no different. Not only are birthing people highly instinctual, they are deeply intuitive when left undisturbed. You know exactly how and when to move your body in concert with your baby. You know when you need silence and when you need to roar. You know who should and should not be in the birth room. You should be supported and encouraged as you set those boundaries. Connecting with this wildness can elicit fear for some and a sense of power and freedom for others. Embracing, appreciating, and preparing for this particular expression of birth can help make your birth a deeply positive experience.'

The intensity is simply a sign that they are on the verge of meeting their baby. And even when there’s a bit more time to go, companions can remind the birthing person that each contraction is bringing them closer to the end goal: meeting their baby.

    tarotReflection: 'Queen of Wands (Cardinal Fire/Aries) Where does my lifeforce originate? What pact with my own power must be made?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Affirmations of your power and strength can bolster your energy and confidence to continue the work of birth. “I am strong.” “My body is powerful.” “You can do this.” Whether you are able to affirm yourself or you rely on those around you to remind you, these words are powerful motivators.'

    title: 'YOU’VE GOT THIS',
    tarotReflection: 'The Emperor (Aries) How can I return to my own bold birthright? How can I reaffirm the right and responsibility of my existence?',
    wisdomOfBirthSupport: 'Unless you prefer silence, generally one can’t hear too much encouragement. “You can do this!” “You’re doing great!” “You’ve got this!” Birthing people can use these votes of confidence from their companions as fuel to keep going. Try taking it one step further: encourage the birthing person to turn the phrase into an “I” statement to make it even more affirming. Say it to yourself, silently or aloud. Speak these words as an expression of self-empowerment. “I’ve got this. I can do this!”'
